## Answers to Prompts
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter has been the application of feature engineering and feature selection in machine learning to enhance credit default prediction. This topic is particularly fascinating because it goes beyond the traditional use of raw or minimally processed data in predictive models. By applying FE and FS to the Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level dataset, we can delve deeper into borrower profiles and generate more accurate and equitable predictions. The process of transforming non-numeric data into meaningful features and selecting the most impactful variables for our model presents a complex, yet intriguing challenge that combines data science, finance, and ethical considerations in lending practices.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For the Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate the integration of alternative data sources into the credit default prediction model to enhance its accuracy and fairness. This investigation would focus on identifying and incorporating non-traditional variables that could be indicative of a borrower's creditworthiness, such as rental payment histories, utility bill payments, or even certain behavioral data gleaned from digital footprints.The primary goal of this investigation would be to explore whether these alternative data points can provide a more holistic view of a borrower's financial stability, especially for those who might not have extensive credit histories. This approach could be particularly beneficial in addressing biases inherent in traditional credit scoring models, which often disadvantage certain demographic groups.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would consider for our current Quarter 1 Project is to incorporate a more diverse set of machine learning models in our analysis. While we focused on using XGBoost due to its efficiency and performance, exploring a variety of other models like neural networks, support vector machines, or ensemble methods could provide a broader understanding of the dataset's nuances. This would not only allow us to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting credit defaults but also potentially uncover hidden patterns or relationships that a single model might miss. Additionally, experimenting with different models could lead to more robust validation of our feature engineering and selection strategies, ensuring that our findings are not just tailored to the idiosyncrasies of a single algorithm.







**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would like to incorporate sentiment analysis and text classification methods to analyze qualitative data, such as borrower's financial behavior descriptions or comments made during the loan application process.Additionally, I am also interested in exploring graph-based algorithms to understand and utilize the relationship networks among borrowers. These networks could be based on various factors like shared financial behaviors, demographic similarities, or interconnected credit histories. Understanding these complex relationships might uncover patterns that are not immediately apparent in isolated data points and could provide valuable insights for predicting credit defaults.
